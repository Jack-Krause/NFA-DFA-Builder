# NFA-DFA-Builder
Given a Regular Language, constructs a DFA or NFA

## Mathematical Definitions
The program accepts a **Language**: A set of strings defined by $L \subseteq \{0, 1\}^{*}$  

i.e.,  $L \subseteq \{0, 1\}^{*}$ is enumerated by $\lambda$, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000, ... where $\lambda$ is the empty string

## Theory of Regular Languages

## Theory of Deterministic Finite Automata

## Current Progress
* Setup
* Need to figure out how to parse set-builder notation. Early implementation will use finite subsets of regular languages
